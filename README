Update: now we have 8 feature functions.

Features for VERB
    VERB comes after "he/she/it/they/you/we"
    If a term has "ed" at the end
    VERB does not come right after another VERB
    VERB does not come after "the" and "a" articles

Features of NOUN
    [removed] If a term ends with "s", it is a (plural) NOUN
    If the previous term is a salutation such as Mr./Ms., the current term is a NOUN.
    If the only the first letter of a term is capitalized, and the term's position in the sentence is not first,
    then the term is a NOUN.

Otherwise the term is OTHER.
    Also, if the previous term is very, current term is an adjective, hence an OTHER.
